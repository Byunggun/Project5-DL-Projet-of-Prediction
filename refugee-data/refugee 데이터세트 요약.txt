*요약:
-Context:
The mass movement of uprooted people is a highly charged geopolitical issue. This data, gathered by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), covers movement of displaced persons (asylum seekers, refugees, internally displaced persons (IDP), stateless). Also included are destination country responses to asylum petitions.

-Content:
This dataset includes 6 csv files covering:

1)Asylum monthly applications opened (asylum_seekers_monthly.csv) {매월 신청}
2)Yearly progress through the refugee system (asylum_seekers.csv)
3)Refugee demographics (demographics.csv)
4)Yearly time series data on UNHCR’s populations of concern (time_series.csv)
5)Yearly population statistics on refugees by residence and destination (persons_of_concern.csv)
6)Yearly data on resettlement arrivals, with or without UNHCR assistance (resettlement.csv)

-Acknowledgements:
This dataset was gathered from UNHCR. Photo by Ali Tareq.

-Inspiration:
What are the most frequent destination countries for refugees?
How has refugee flow changed?
Any trends that could predict future refugee patterns?
